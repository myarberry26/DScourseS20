\section{Web Scrapping}
Since I am studying Sports Data Analytics, I am looking forward too and interested in scraping data off the web in sports. I would love to scrap data off the web for college sports such as basketball and/or football. My thesis is directed towards donor donation gift patterns back to the university and correlations with several variables one is the performance of the football team. 

\section{SparkR}
For the answers to question 6 about setting up two different dataframes in R, df and df1 were set up using the data iris and were input and setup two different ways but when working through the exercise the data was output for both looked the same. I think this happened becasue they were using the same dataset even though they used different commands to set them up.
