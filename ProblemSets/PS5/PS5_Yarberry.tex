\section{Problem 3}
For my non API web scrapping, I scrap some National Championship history of Division I college football programs, the chart I was able to scrap is not only the count of National titles each school has along with each year they won the title. This data is more relevant to me in looking at research and topic ideas, I currently am study college football patterns in particular though that pertain to donor gifts including major gifts back to the athletic department, and does much an effect does winning a National Championship have on gifts. I crapped my data using rvest which is similar to the example we went over in class. 

\section{Problem 4}
For problem four I scrapped data from Yahoo Finance and in particular Nike's stock, and I used htmlTreeParse. I parsed the data from the site without using an API code and was able to download the data straight from the website using a URl. I then broke down the data into section more readable that I could use, this data will also be undated ad the stock changes if refreshed. I don't particular need Nike stock for any of my current projects but could be a contributing factor in college football programs which is my topic of study.
